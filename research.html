  <h2>Honors 202 Research Proposal</h2>
  <h3>Lena Hall</h3>

  <p> In an article written by Nour Mheidly, Mohamad Y. Fares, Hussain Zalzale, and Jawad Fares entitled, “Effect of Face Masks on Interpersonal Communication During the COVID-19 Pandemic”, they delve into how the pandemic has changed the way that we can communicate in person. In this article, they cover how face masks make communication more difficult because it’s hard to understand expression. One of the problems here is that with the younger generation in college right now, expression and body language is much more different. I would like to look at this more specifically in the age range of 18 to 23 years. Another article, “Communication Patterns and Media Technology Role in Organization and Society During Pandemic”, written by Andhita Vidya Putri and Irwansyah Irwansyah, looks at communication through the lens of technology. This is a really interesting source for my research proposal because when looking at college students, technology is a major factor in communication and this article helps to provide a lot of that information. While it still is a lot broader than I would like, it still is a great resource.
</p>
  <p>In this proposal, I want to explore why expression and human contact has such an
important role in communication and how that has been affected during the pandemic. I think that this idea has been clearly confirmed because we’ve all been living in the pandemic, but I want to ask a different question, what? What has changed in the way that we communicate? </p>
<p> To conduct this study, I would interview willing participants for their input on the matter. I feel like this is the best option to test my hypothesis because the most accurate way to test how college students have been affected by the pandemic is to ask actual college students. I would do this test on local college students, specifically in the age range of 19 to 24, of any race or gender. The goal here is to learn more about people of a certain age, everything else doesn’t matter as much and gives more perspective. I think to vary this hypothesis, interviewing a few people outside of the target group would be smart. I think varying this would help show how the effect on college students may be different than other age groups. I want to know how communication changes may have an effect on the mental health of this age group specifically because there’s a larger impact of technology than older generations and I want to see how that’s affected it. I think this hypothesis could be disconfirmed if the other tested groups have the same responses and they don’t vary from the original testing group. A control is something I am still currently working on because it’s impossible to find someone who hasn’t been affected by the pandemic, so that is something I am still working on. Instead of a typical experiment, I’d just have my participants answer a series of questions to see how they’ve been affected individually. I would hope that the results of this would come back in support of the hypothesis, but as stated before, there are some possibilities that could disprove the hypothesis.
