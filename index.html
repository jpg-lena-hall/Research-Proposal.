	    <h1>Hon 202 Research Proposal</h1>
		  <h3>Introduction</h3>
		  <p>In this research proposal, I will be examining how quarantine has affected college student’s ability to communicate. This idea is important because now that the world is opening back up after a year and a half of isolation, we’re not quite sure how to properly communicate with each other.</p>
